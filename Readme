Some tips for developing with react native. 

Run npm start while in react native directory. Open expo link on iphone with exp:// link in browser. 

common git commands:

git checkout -b name_of_newbranch this is to switch to branches or create a new one

git status tells you which branch you are currently in

git add . (with the period) adds all newly edited files to be commited

git commit -m "type msg for commit"

git push origin branch_name pushes to your branch

my branch is intergrating with heroku for the backend

Because we are using react native which runs on a mobile we cannot have the front and backend code in the same repos

I have included instructiosn on how to get the heroku backend repo on your machine in the herokuBackend file.
