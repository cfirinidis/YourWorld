Our app UrWrld can allow a user to check in and check out of a location.  

It allows them to enter an age and hobby on their profile and save it in our database.  It allows a user, once logged in, to create a place for other users to check in and out of.  

Once they are checked in to a location they can view other users that are currently checked in as well. 



Our app uses React-Native frontend with a Node.js and Express.js backend. 

Our backend is hosted and deployed on Heroku.  

Our database is a Mysql db using the heroku add-on, Cleardb.

Some tips for developing with react native. 

Run npm start while in react native directory. Open expo link on iphone with exp:// link in browser. 

common git commands:

git checkout -b name_of_newbranch this is to switch to branches or create a new one

git status tells you which branch you are currently in

git add . (with the period) adds all newly edited files to be commited

git commit -m "type msg for commit"

git push origin branch_name pushes to your branch

my branch is intergrating with heroku for the backend

Because we are using react native which runs on a mobile we cannot have the front and backend code in the same repos

I have included instructions on how to get the heroku backend repo on your machine in the herokuBackend file.
